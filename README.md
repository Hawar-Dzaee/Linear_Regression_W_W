# Multivariable Linear Regression Web Application

This web application visualizes a multivariable linear regression model with two features and its corresponding loss landscape. Users can interact with the model by adjusting weights (w1, w2) using widgets, and observe how changes affect the loss function and help reach the global minima.


## Features

* Plot of Multivariable Linear Regression Model: Visualizes how the model fits a given dataset with two features.

* Loss Landscape Plot: Shows the Mean Squared Error (MSE) landscape for different values of weights.

* Interactive Widgets: Adjust weights (w1, w2) in real-time and see the effect on the loss function and regression line.

* Equations Display: Displays the equations used in the plots:
      Linear Regression Equation: Used in the first plot.
      Mean Squared Error (MSE) Equation: Used in the second plot.
